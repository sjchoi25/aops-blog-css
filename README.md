# aops-blog-css
A simple CSS framework that requires minimal knowledge of CSS that can be used on AoPS blogs.

## Usage
Use import commands to import the CSS into your blog like this:
```css
@import url("https://Nhv24.github.io/aops-blog-css/<INSERT FILE NAME>");
```

## Custom files
Note that you can get custom files by using url parameters and importing the files from [replit.com](https://replit.com/@player010/Fire-css) (Note that Firecss in replit is created by Nhv24) My replit username is player010.

**WARNING:** Note that replit imports can significantly increase your blog loading time since it relies off of a server. This server may not respond at times and the blog may not render as wanted. Please use this at your own risk.

#### Note: In the event of a significant update on the part of [artofproblemsolving.com](https://www.artofproblemsolving.com), the CSS in this repository will not necessarily be also updated.

### NOTICE 
The CSS in this repository is not created by or affiliated with AoPS Incorporated.
