# aops-blog-css
A simple CSS framework that requires minimal knowledge of CSS that can be used on AoPS blogs.

## Usage
Use import commands to import the CSS into your blog like this:
```css
@import url("https://Nhv24.github.io/aops-blog-css/<INSERT FILE NAME>");
```

## Custom files
Note that you can get custom files by using url parameters and importing the files from [replit.com](https://replit.com/@player010/Fire-css) (Note that Firecss in replit is created by Nhv24) My replit username is player010.

**WARNING:** Note that replit imports can significantly increase your blog loading time since it relies off of a server. This server may not respond at times and the blog may not render as wanted. Please use this at your own risk.

Here is the current list of files that you can request from replit:

[FONT](https://css.firecss.repl.co/font.css?family=EXAMPLE+FONT): The parameter is **family**. This returns a stylesheet that applies the font to the whole AoPS Blog.

#### Note: In the event of a significant update on the part of [artofproblemsolving.com](https://www.artofproblemsolving.com), the CSS in this repository will not necessarily be also updated.
